# Finding-Donors-Using-ML
This project I worked on during my Machine Learning Cross-Skilling NANODEGREE Program. The aim of this project is to build a model that predicts the potential charity donors based on predicting how much they are making money a year. Based on the previously mentioned predicted feature we label them as potential chairty donors or not.
